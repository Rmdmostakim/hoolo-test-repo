                    <Faq question="What is Hoolo's Policy towards counterfeit items?">
                        Hoolo has a Zero Tolerance Policy towards Counterfeit products. It is each sellerâ€™s responsibility to source and sell only authentic products and to immediately deactivate any product that is in violation of our guidelines: <br/>
                        Items that apply a trademark (e.g. a brand or character logo) on the product, the product packaging, or anywhere in relation with the product, without authorization by the trademark owner.<br/>
                        Items that contain specific design elements (e.g. cartoon characters or colorways) protected by a trademark, without the authorization by the trademark owner.<br/>
                        Items that bear such similarities with other products that they are likely to deceive buyers into thinking they are made or sold by the owner of the other product's brand (e.g. a replica of a branded item with or without altered logos).<br/>
                        Items that are in violation of any local country laws in which they are sold.
                        In case of any doubt we advise you to talk to the manufacturer and/or distributor of the products, and to your legal advisors. Hoolo will collaborate closely with brand owners, its customers and the authorities to prevent the sale of counterfeit items.

                    <Faq question="Is Hoolo concerned about counterfeit items?">
                        Hoolo has a Zero Tolerance Policy towards counterfeit products. It is the seller's responsibility to source and sell only authentic products and to deactivate any product that violates our guidelines:<br/>
                        Trademark applications (such as a brand or character logo) that appear on a product or its packaging without the trademark owner's permission.<br/>
                        Use of trademarked design elements (e.g. cartoon characters, colorways) without permission of the trademark owner.<br/>
                        Almost identical products are likely to deceive buyers into thinking they are made or sold by the brand's owner (e.g. replicas of branded items with or without altered logos).
                        It is illegal for a product to be sold in a country where it is illegal.<br/>
                        In case you have any doubts about the products, as well as the manufacturer and/or distributor, we recommend that you consult your legal advisors. By working closely with brand owners, customers, and authorities, the company prevents counterfeit goods from reaching the market.
